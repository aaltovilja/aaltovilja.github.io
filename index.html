                    <p> </p>
                    <p> I am an artist located in Helsinki, Finland. This spring, I completed my Bachelor of Arts degree in communication and studio arts from Rollins College. I'm currently looking for new career prospects while simultaneously taking marketing courses. I aim to continue my studies in a master's program, but for the time being, I'm seeking for entry-level work to help me advance in my professional career.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>Even though I love painting, sculpture, and other traditional mediums, graphic design and illustrations are the honey to my tea.  I enjoy working with digital tools like Procreate, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, but occasionally I find myself playing around with 3D rendering software like Blender and Cinema 4D. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I derive inspiration from old movies, nostalgic old album covers and images that proliferate on social media. I am a huge fan of sleek artworks and bold colors, as they are so stationary and straightforward, and creating illustrations might be the only way to express myself – openly and boldly.</p>

                        Prograde & Retrograde</a>  was Rollins College's art majors' final exhibition, celebrating the culmination of their capstone projects. Memory, time, nostalgia, misperception, and identity are among the themes explored by the seniors in their bodies of work.</p>
